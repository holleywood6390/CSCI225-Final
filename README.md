## Project Description:
For our project, we have created a Math Quiz hub. This hub consists of ten different quizzes
of varying Mathematical topics and varying levels of difficulty for each topic.
The user will be able to log their name and view high scores through a leaderboard
page.
## Bug Report: 
Everything runs as it should, however, the access to Firebase ends on 12/8/22,
so accessing the database after the class ends will not be possible.
