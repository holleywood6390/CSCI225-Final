# Math Quiz Website
## Developers:
#### -Christian Holley cjholley@usca.edu
#### -Jonathan "Jake" Walker jew6@usca.edu
#### -Adam Buchanan adamwb@usca.edu
## Project Description:
#### For our project, we have created a Math Quiz hub. This hub consists of ten different quizzes of varying Mathematical topics and varying levels of difficulty for each topic. The user will be able to log their name and view high scores through a leaderboard page.
## Bug Report: 
#### -The Leaderboards should be displaying names as well as scores, but it returns "undefined" instead, not sure why. 
#### -The access to Firebase ends on 12/8/22, so accessing the database after the class ends will not be possible.
