        <h1>Website Description:</h1>

        <p> This project is designed to test the math skills of the taker across many different areas of the math field.
            Each quiz features multiple difficulties allowing it to test anyone from beginner to math wizard.
            While the quiz maintains a simplistic design across the board, it is plenty enough to test your mind thanks to the 
            combination of HTML, CSS Design, JavaScript and use of databases throughout.
