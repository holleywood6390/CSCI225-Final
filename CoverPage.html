            <p>This project is designed to test your math skills across many different areas of the math field.</p>
            <p>Each quiz features multiple difficulties allowing it to test anyone from beginner to math wizard.</p>
            <p>While the quiz maintains a simple design across the board, it is plenty enough to test your mind thanks to the combination of HTML, CSS Design, JavaScript and use of databases throughout.</p>
